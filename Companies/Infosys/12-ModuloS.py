# You are given an integer N.
# You have to choose a set of integers S from the range (1, N-1) such
# that the product of integers in S is 1 modulo N. This means that if N=5,
# we can choose set S = [1,2,3] as the product is 6 and 6 modulo 5 is 1.
# Find the length of the biggest set S you can choose.

# Input Format
# The first line contains an integer, N, denoting the given integer.
# 7       5
# We can choose set
# (1,2,3,4,5). Here product = 120 which mod7 is 1
