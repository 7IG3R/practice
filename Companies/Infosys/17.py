# Given a number N
# Let X denote the minimum integer value such that the product of digits of X is equal
# to N. Then S is a string denoting decimal representation of X
# Find the value of S

# • It is guaranteed that the answer always exists.
# • It is given that the length of S must be greater than or equal to 2.

# 8     18 

# Here the product of 18 is 8 and is min such number.

# 120   358
