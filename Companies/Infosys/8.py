# A college needs to verify the documents of all the students before the exam commences. 
# In order to do this efficiently the college will setup K booths. Each booth will contain Pi.
# counselors that will all perform a single part of the verification. Each student must visit 
# all k booths to register to activity.

# A student needs to visit all booths from 1 to K in order to complete their registration for
# campus season. You are given the list of appointments of all N students registering for
# campus activities in the array A. This means that ith student will be allowed to start
# the process for campus registration at A[i] minutes. Additionally, you are given the time
# T[i] taken for verification at the ith booth.

# Let S denote an array containing the time taken for each student to visit all K booths
# Then, L is equal to Max(S1,..Sn). Your task is to find the minimum possible value of L
