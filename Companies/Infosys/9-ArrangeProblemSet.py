# You have N problems as problem i has difficulty A[i], you need to arrange in minimum possible
# number of problem sets such that within each problem set 

# The problem-set consists of at least K problems.
# The difference of difficulty between any two problems is less than or equal to D.
# Find the minimum total number of problem-sets
# Note:
# No problem can be in more than one problem-set and all problems should be
# divided between problem-sets.
# If there is no possible way of arranging the problems into problem-set then return -1

# Input Format
# the first line contains an integer N, Denoting the number of elements in A
# The next line contain an integer, K, denoting the described integer K.
# The next line contains an integer, D, denoting the described integer D.
# veAra
# Each line i' of the N subsequent lines (where O <= i < N) contains an integer describing A[i]
